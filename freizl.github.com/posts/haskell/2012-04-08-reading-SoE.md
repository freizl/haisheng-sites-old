## Notes
### Chapter 1
   - In Haskell, the objects that we perform calculations on are called _expressions_, 
     and the objects that result from a calculation are called _values_. \
     **It is helpful to think of a value just as expression on which no more calculation can be carried out.**
   - You can think of types as set of expressions (or values) in which
     members of same set have much in common.
