* Notes
** Chapter 1
   - In Haskell, the objects that we perform calculations on are
     called _expressions_, and the objects that result from a
     calculation are called _values_. *It is helpful to think of a
     value just as expression on which no more calculation can be
     carried out.*
   - You can think of types as set of expressions (or values) in which
     members of same set have much in common.
